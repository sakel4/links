# Astro Personal Links Page

This is a simple personal links page built with Astro.

## Reasoning behind the project
It is a static site that is deployed to Vercel.
I built this site to make it easier to share my social media links with others,\ instead of heaving to use a linktree or something similar.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
